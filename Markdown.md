# Project Guardian 2.0 - PII Redaction Deployment Proposal

**Layer:** Sidecar container / API Gateway plugin

**Rationale:** Intercept and sanitize all JSON payloads containing PII before storage or processing. This ensures consistent protection across microservices and external integrations.

**Advantages:**
- Real-time PII detection and redaction
- Scalable with microservices
- Low latency (<10ms per request)
- Centralized updates
- Cost-effective and easy to integrate

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Package the Python detector as a Docker image.
2. Deploy as a sidecar container alongside all relevant services.
3. Route API requests/responses through the sidecar.
4. Maintain audit logs of redactions for monitoring and compliance.

**Security Impact:**
- Prevents leakage of standalone and combinatorial PII
- Reduces risk of fraud and regulatory non-compliance
